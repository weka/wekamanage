# Docker Compose configuration files

The files here are container stanzas for the varius WEKAmon containers.

The idea is if a service is enabled, the associated stanza is copied to the docker-compose.yml file, and the 
docker-compose.yml can be customized by this UI, turning services on and off as desired.
